# Welcome to the Design Patterns in Vanilla JS Guide

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of design patterns in vanilla JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable information and practical examples here.

### Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are essential for building robust and maintainable applications. They provide reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. By understanding and implementing these patterns, you can improve your code's clarity, efficiency, and scalability.

<!-- ### Categories of Design Patterns

This guide covers three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**

   - **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
   - **Factory**: Create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

2. **Structural Patterns**

   - **Adapter**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   - **Decorator**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Observer**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. -->
